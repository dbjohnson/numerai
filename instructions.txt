# Numerai Tournament Mechanics

Here we discuss data, tournament evaluation, and payouts.

## Training Data

#### numerai_training_data.csv
Use this dataset to train your machine learning algorithm. The first fourteen
columns (`f1` - `f14`) are integer features. Column `c1` is a categorical
feature, column validation indicates a dataset that you can use to validate
your model, and target is the binary class you’re trying to predict.

## Tournament Data

#### numerai_tournament_data.csv
Once you’ve built your model, you can use it to generate probability estimates
on this new dataset.

## Upload Predictions

You can then upload your predictions, and see how well your model performed
versus the other tournament participants. The format of your prediction upload
should be a csv with two columns `t_id` and `probability`.

To upload your predictions, login and click the *Upload Predictions* button on
the homepage. Your score will appear on the leaderboard.

## Evaluation

To be successful a lot of your predictions need to be correct, and where your
model shows the most confident predictions, it need to be especially correct
then. We evaluate your models with the [Area Under The Receiver Operator
Characteristic Curve measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).
We only report your AUC score on 1/3rd of the predictions you submit. This
prevents overfitting.

## Payouts

The leaderboard will change frequently as new predictions are uploaded, and so
payouts will change too. To receive payment, you need to have placed in the top
10 when the timer runs out, and furthermore you need to come back to apply your
model to a new live dataset to claim your prize. We will email you a link to a
live encrypted dataset to predict on when the timer runs out. You’ll have 24
hours to use your model to predict on this dataset. By requiring that you upload
predictions, instead of the code related to your model, we ensure that you can
retain all intellectual property rights to your model. You never have to tell us
how you built your model. It’s yours forever, and you can apply your ideas to
all of our subsequent tournaments, and soon submit your predictions directly to
our API.

We want you to be able to remain completely anonymous on Numerai. To facilitate
anonymity, we offer payments in Bitcoin as well as USD.
